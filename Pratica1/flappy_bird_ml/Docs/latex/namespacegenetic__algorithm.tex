\begin{DoxyVerb}Gathers data from all players' neural networks, evaluates how well they did and attributes a random probability of being matched with another
player in order to create a new descendant with their combined characteristics - This random probability is influenced by the overall score of the player
(i.e how well the player did).
Aditionally, the mutation_rate variable gives the descendent the probability of developing a mutation in their weights. This mutation causes that weight to take on
a random value rather than the parent's combined weights in order to produce a more varied generation that may (or may not) lead to quicker or better developments
